Terraform configurations for provisioning AWS infrastructure. Includes remote backend setup using S3 and DynamoDB for state management.

## terraform-project folder Terraform Files Overview

- **`ec2.tf`** â€“ Defines and provisions 3 EC2 instances with unique names using a variable list.
- **`variables.tf`** â€“ Contains reusable input variables for EC2 instance names and S3 bucket name.
- **`output.tf`** â€“ Displays the public IP addresses of all created EC2 instances after apply.
- **`bucket.tf`** â€“ Intended to create an S3 bucket using a variable name.
- **`provider.tf`** â€“ Configures the AWS provider and sets the deployment region (`us-east-2`).
- **`terraform.tf`** â€“ Specifies the required provider source and version for the AWS provider.
- **`terraform2.tf`** â€“ Contains optional configuration for using a remote S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking.

> **Note:** If a resource file (like `bucket.tf` or `terraform2.tf`) is currently commented out and you want to use it, **remove the comments** before running `terraform init` and `terraform plan`.


## backend folder Terraform Files Overview

- **`backend.tf`** â€“ Provisions an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table to be used for Terraform remote state backend and state locking.
- **`variables.tf`** â€“ Contains variables for the S3 bucket name and DynamoDB table name used in the backend configuration.


ðŸ”„ Syncing Terraform State After Manual Changes
If an instance was manually deleted and you want Terraform to recreate it:

terraform apply
This will recreate the missing resource(s) as defined in your configuration.

If you don't want to recreate it and just want to sync the state with real infrastructure:

terraform apply -refresh-only
This updates the Terraform state file to match the actual infrastructure without applying any changes.
